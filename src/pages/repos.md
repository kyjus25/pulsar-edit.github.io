The Pulsar project is split up into a number of repositories, all hosted on
GitHub.

The very nature of the way Pulsar works means that there are a large number of
packages that come together to make up the editor and each of these have their
own repository.

We also have a number of other repositories to host the website, package backend
& frontend and our organization wide documentation & templates.

All of the Pulsar repositories can be found under the organization at
[https://github.com/pulsar-edit](https://github.com/pulsar-edit) but below is a
list of some of the more regularly used ones you may wish to visit in order to
contribute to the project. For a more comprehensive list you can visit the
