::: warning
Please note that its possible this is outdated, as its original version was published by @'Damein Guard' on Feb 16, 2018.
:::

In order to properly analyze Java files a project definition must be found that indicates the packages, paths to search for classes etc.

You should open the folder that contains the pom.xml or build.gradle file if you want full diagnostics, errors, auto-completion etc.

If you don't need the full analysis you can ignore this warning and work with a subset of the available features.
