## Looking Back

- Beta launch went very well
- Relatively few problems
- Performance work @smashwilson and @kuychaco did is âœ¨
- GPG/credential helper work that @smashwilson shipped was solid
- Feeling good about shipping to stable

## This Month

- Ensure room to triage and fix issues that may arise after shipping to stable
- File change notification service @smashwilson
- GitHub integration @BinaryMuse @kuychaco
  - Create new PR
  - Fill out existing functionality (timeline item types, new fields, etc.)
  - Add mechanism for manual/auto refreshing
  - Continue to investigate possibility of real-time updates
- Git integration @kuychaco
  - Add "last commit(s)" view under commit box
  - Investigate removing amend checkbox in favor of more robust HEAD management

## Other Topics Discussed

- Web Workers
  - Wait to see if issues arise with current implementation
- Better remote/branch management
  - Existing UI mocks are relatively old and pre-docks
  - Want to ensure what we ship is close to what we'll want long term to ensure UI/UX stability over time
  - Resume conversation around design and pick this up in coming months
- `core:undo` support
  - Undo support is a misnomer in a system where there's not a linear set of edits
  - Want to design a system where any action is recoverable (different from undoable)
  - Really talking about UI Git porcelain at this point
  - Start deeper conversations now, talk about more at mini-summit
- Git log / graph
  - We could do something simple now very quickly but would it be up to the standards we want?
  - Decided to work on "last commit(s)" view for June, talk about this more at mini-summit
- Stash support
  - Start talking about UI/UX
- Additional GitHub PR work
  - "Checking out" a PR from the GH pane is a great first step toward implementing a full code review flow
