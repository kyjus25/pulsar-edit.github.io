## Maintaining Your Packages

::: info Pre-release information

This section is about a feature in pre-release. The information below documents
the intended functionality but there is still ongoing work to support these
features with stability.

:::

While publishing is, by far, the most common action you will perform when
working with the packages you provide, there are other things you may need to do.

### Publishing a Package Manually

::: danger STOP

Publishing a package manually is not a recommended practice and is only for the
advanced user who has published packages before. If you perform the steps wrong,
you may be unable to publish the new version of your package and may have to
completely unpublish your package in order to correct the faulty state. You have
been warned.

:::

Some people prefer to control every aspect of the package publishing process.
Normally, the ppm tool manages certain details during publishing to keep things
consistent and make everything work smoothly. If you're one of those people that
prefers to do things manually, there are certain steps you'll have to take in
order to make things work just as smoothly as if ppm has taken care of things
for you.

::: note

**Note:** The ppm tool will only publish and [https://pulsar-edit.dev](https://web.pulsar-edit.dev)
will only list packages that are hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com),
regardless of what process is used to publish them.

:::

When you have completed the changes that you want to publish and are ready to
start the publishing process, you must perform the following steps on the
`master` branch:

1. Update the version number in your package's `package.json`. The version
   number **must** match the regular expression: `^\d+\.\d+\.\d+`
2. Commit the version number change
3. Create a Git tag referencing the above commit. The tag **must** match the
   regular expression `^v\d+\.\d+\.\d+` and the part after the `v` **must** match
   the full text of the version number in the `package.json`
4. Execute `git push --follow-tags`
5. Execute `pulsar -p publish --tag tagname` where `tagname` **must** match the
   name of the tag created in the above step

### Adding a Collaborator

Some packages get too big for one person. Sometimes priorities change and
someone else wants to help out. You can let others help or create co-owners by
[adding them as a collaborator](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository/)
on the GitHub repository for your package. _Note:_ Anyone that has push access
to your repository will have the ability to publish new versions of the package
that belongs to that repository.

You can also have packages that are owned by a [GitHub organization](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-organization-account/).
Anyone who is a member of an organization's [team](https://help.github.com/articles/permission-levels-for-an-organization/)
which has push access to the package's repository will be able to publish new
versions of the package.

### Transferring Ownership

::: danger STOP

ðŸš¨ This is a permanent change. There is no going back! ðŸš¨

:::

If you want to hand off support of your package to someone else, you can do that
by [transferring the package's repository](https://help.github.com/articles/transferring-a-repository/)
to the new owner. Once you do that, they can publish a new version with the
updated repository information in the `package.json`.

### Unpublish Your Package

If you no longer want to support your package and cannot find anyone to take it
over, you can unpublish your package from [https://pulsar-edit.dev](https://web.pulsar-edit.dev).
For example, if your package is named `package-name` then the command you would
execute is:

```sh
$ pulsar -p unpublish <package-name>
```

This will remove your package from the [https://pulsar-edit.dev](https://web.pulsar-edit.dev)
package registry. Anyone who has already downloaded a copy of your package will
still have it and be able to use it, but it will no longer be available for
installation by others.

#### Unpublish a Specific Version

If you mistakenly published a version of your package or perhaps you find a
glaring bug or security hole, you may want to unpublish just that version of
your package. For example, if your package is named `package-name` and the bad
version of your package is v1.2.3 then the command you would execute is:

```sh
$ pulsar -p unpublish <package-name@1.2.3>
```

This will remove just this particular version from the [https://pulsar-edit.dev](https://web.pulsar-edit.dev)
package registry.

### Rename Your Package

If you need to rename your package for any reason, you can do so with one simple
command â€“ `pulsar -p publish --rename` changes the `name` field in your package's
`package.json`, pushes a new commit and tag, and publishes your renamed package.
Requests made to the previous name will be forwarded to the new name.

```sh
$ pulsar -p publish --rename <new-package-name>
```

::: tip

**Tip:** Once a package name has been used, it cannot be re-used by another
package even if the original package is unpublished.
