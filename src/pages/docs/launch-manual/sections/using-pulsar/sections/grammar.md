## Grammar

The "grammar" of a file is what language Pulsar has associated with that file.
Types of grammars would include "Java" or "GitHub-Flavored Markdown". We looked
at this a bit when we created some snippets in [Snippets](#snippets).

When you load a file, Pulsar does a little work to try to figure out what type
of file it is. Largely this is accomplished by looking at its file extension
(`.md` is generally a Markdown file, etc.), though sometimes it has to inspect
the content a bit to figure it out.

When you open a file and Pulsar can't determine a grammar for the file, it will
default to "Plain Text", which is the simplest one. If it does default to
"Plain Text", picks the wrong grammar for the file, or if for any reason you
wish to change the selected grammar, you can pull up the Grammar Selector with
<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+L</kbd>.

When the grammar of a file is changed, Atom will remember that for the current
session.

The Grammar Selector functionality is implemented in the [grammar-selector](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/tree/master/packages/grammar-selector)
package.
