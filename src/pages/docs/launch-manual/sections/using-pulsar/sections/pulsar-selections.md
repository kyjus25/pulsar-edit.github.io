## Pulsar Selections

Text selections in Pulsar support a number of actions, such as scoping deletion,
indentation and search actions, and marking text for actions such as quoting and
bracketing.

Selections mirror many of the movement commands. They're actually exactly the
same keybindings as the movement commands, but with a <kbd>Shift</kbd> key added
in.
