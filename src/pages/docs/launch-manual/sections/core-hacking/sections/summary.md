## Summary

If you finished this chapter, you should be an Pulsar-hacking master. We've
discussed how you should work with JavaScript and CoffeeScript, and how to put
it to good use in creating packages. You should also be able to do this in your
own created theme now.

Even when something goes wrong, you should be able to debug this easily. But
also fewer things should go wrong, because you are capable of writing great
specs for Pulsar.

In the next chapter, weâ€™ll go into more of a deep dive on individual internal
APIs and systems of Pulsar, even looking at some Pulsar source to see how things
are really getting done.
