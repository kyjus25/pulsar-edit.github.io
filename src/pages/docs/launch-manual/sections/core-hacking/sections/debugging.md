## Debugging

Pulsar provides several tools to help you understand unexpected behavior and
debug problems. This guide describes some of those tools and a few approaches to
help you debug and provide more helpful information when [submitting issues](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs):

### Update to the Latest Version

You might be running into an issue which was already fixed in a more recent
version of Pulsar than the one you're using.

If you're using a released version, check which version of Pulsar you're using:

```sh
$ pulsar --version
> Pulsar  : 1.63.0-dev
> Electron: 12.2.3
> Chrome  : 89.0.4389.128
> Node    : 14.16.0
```

<!--The below does not exist yet, uncomment or update when it is-->
<!--Then check for the [latest released version](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/releases/latest).-->

You can find the latest releases on the [Pulsar Website](https://pulsar-edit.dev/download.html),
follow the links for either the latest release or Cirrus CI version. Make sure
to mention which version when logging an issue.

<!-- TODO: This section may need re-instating once/if we have auto-updates working again
::: tabs#Updating

@tab Linux

To update to the latest version, you can download it from
[the Pulsar website](https://pulsar-edit.dev/) or [the latest release on GitHub](https://github.com/atom/atom/releases/latest)
and follow the [Installation instructions for Pulsar on Linux](../../getting-started/#installing-pulsar).

@tab macOS

If there is a more recent release available, you can update to the most recent
release with the auto-update functionality built in to Pulsar and the
[about package](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/tree/master/packages/about).
You can open the About View by using the _Pulsar > About_ menu option to see
whether Pulsar is up-to-date, downloading a new update or click the button to
"Restart and Install Update".

@tab Windows

If there is a more recent release available, you can update to the most recent
release with the auto-update functionality built in to Pulsar and the
[about package](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/tree/master/packages/about).
You can open the About View by using the _Help > About_ menu option to see
whether Pulsar is up-to-date, downloading a new update or click the button to
"Restart and Install Update".

:::

-->

If you're building Pulsar from source, pull down the latest version of master
and [re-build](#building-pulsar). Make sure that if logging an issue you include
the latest commit hash you built from.

### Using Safe Mode

A large part of Pulsar's functionality comes from packages you can install.
Pulsar will also execute the code in your [init script](#the-init-file) on
startup. In some cases, these packages and the code in the init script might be
causing unexpected behavior, problems, or performance issues.

To determine if that is happening, start Pulsar from the terminal in safe mode:

```sh
$ pulsar --safe
```

This starts Pulsar, but does not load packages from
**_LNX/MAC_**: `~/.pulsar/packages` or `~/.pulsar/dev/packages` -
**_WIN_**: `%USERPROFILE%\.pulsar\packages` or `%USERPROFILE%\.pulsar\dev\packages`.
and disables loading of your init script. If you can no longer reproduce the
problem in safe mode, it's likely it was caused by one of the packages or the
init script.

If removing or commenting out all content from the init script and starting
Pulsar normally still produces the error, then try figuring out which package is
causing trouble. Start Pulsar normally again and open the Settings View with
**_LNX/WIN_**: <kbd>Ctrl+,</kbd> -
**_MAC_**: <kbd>Cmd+,</kbd>.
Since the Settings View allows you to disable each
installed package, you can disable packages one by one until you can no longer
reproduce the issue. Restart Pulsar or reload Pulsar with
**_LNX/WIN_**: <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+F5</kbd> -
**_MAC_**: <kbd>Alt+Cmd+Ctrl+L</kbd>.
after you disable each package to make sure it's completely gone.

When you find the problematic package, you can disable or uninstall the package.
We strongly recommend creating an issue on the package's GitHub repository.

### Clearing Saved State

Pulsar saves a number of things about your environment when you exit in order to
restore Pulsar to the same configuration when you next launch the program. In
some cases the state that gets saved can be something undesirable that prevents
Pulsar from working properly. In these cases, you may want to clear the state
that Pulsar has saved.

::: danger DANGER

Clearing the saved state permanently destroys any state that Pulsar has saved
_across all projects_. This includes unsaved changes to files you may have been
editing in all projects. This is a destructive action.

:::

Clearing the saved state can be done by opening a terminal and executing:

```sh
$ pulsar --clear-window-state
```

### Reset to Factory Defaults

In some cases, you may want to reset Pulsar to "factory defaults", in other
words clear all of your configuration and remove all packages. This can easily
be done by opening a terminal and executing:

::: tabs#debugging

@tab Linux

```sh
$ mv ~/.pulsar ~/.pulsar-backup
```

@tab macOS

```sh
$ mv ~/.pulsar ~/.pulsar-backup
```

@tab Windows

```sh
$ rename %USERPROFILE%\.pulsar .pulsar-backup
```

:::

Once that is complete, you can launch Pulsar as normal. Everything will be just
as if you first installed Pulsar.

::: tip Tip

The command given above doesn't delete the old configuration, just puts it
somewhere that Pulsar can't find it. If there are pieces of the old
configuration you want to retrieve, you can find them in the
**_LNX/MAC_**: `~/.pulsar-backup` -
**_WIN_**: `%USERPROFILE%\.pulsar-backup`
directory.

:::

### Check for Linked Packages

If you develop or contribute to Pulsar packages, there may be left-over packages
linked to your
**_LNX/MAC_**: `~/.pulsar/packages` or `~/.pulsar/dev/packages` -
**_WIN_**: `%USERPROFILE%\.pulsar\packages` or `%USERPROFILE%\.pulsar\dev\packages`.
directories. You can use the `pulsar -p links` command to list all linked
packages:

```sh
$ pulsar -p links
> /Users/pulsy/.pulsar/dev/packages (0)
> └── (no links)
> /Users/pulsy/.pulsar/packages (1)
> └── color-picker -> /Users/pulsy/github/color-picker
```

You can remove links using the `pulsar -p unlink` command:

```sh
$ pulsar -p unlink color-picker
> Unlinking /Users/pulsy/.pulsar/packages/color-picker ✓
```

See `pulsar -p links --help` and `pulsar -p unlink --help` for more information
on these commands.

::: tip Tip

You can also use `pulsar -p unlink --all` to easily unlink all packages and
themes.

:::

### Check for Incompatible Packages

If you have packages installed that use native Node modules, when you upgrade to
a new version of Pulsar, they might need to be rebuilt. Pulsar detects this and
through the [incompatible-packages package](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/pulsar/tree/master/packages/incompatible-packages)
displays an indicator in the status bar when this happens.

![Incompatible Packages Status Bar Indicator](@images/atom/incompatible-packages-indicator.png "Incompatible Packages Status Bar Indicator")

If you see this indicator, click it and follow the instructions.

### Check Pulsar and Package Settings

In some cases, unexpected behavior might be caused by settings in Pulsar or in
one of the packages.

Open Pulsar's [Settings View](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/settings-view) with
**_LNX/WIN_**: <kbd>Ctrl+,</kbd> -
**_MAC_**: <kbd>Cmd+,</kbd>,
the
**_LNX_**: _Edit > Preferences_ -
**_MAC_**: _Pulsar > Preferences_ -
**_WIN_**: _File > Preferences_
menu option, or the `Settings View: Open` command from the
[Command Palette](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/command-palette).

![Settings View](@images/atom/settings-view.png)

Check Pulsar's settings in the Settings View, there's a description of most
configuration options in the [Basic Customization section](../../using-pulsar/#configuration-key-reference).
For example, if you want Pulsar to hide the invisible symbols representing
whitespace characters, disable the "Show Invisibles" option.

Some of these options are also available on a per-language basis which means
that they may be different for specific languages, for example JavaScript or
Python. To check the per-language settings, open the settings for the language
package under the Packages tab in the Settings View, for example the
language-javascript or language-python package.

Since Pulsar ships with a set of packages and you can also install additional
packages yourself, check the list of packages and their settings. For instance,
if you'd like to get rid of the vertical line in the middle of the editor,
disable the [Wrap Guide package](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/wrap-guide).
And if you don't like it when Pulsar strips trailing whitespace or ensures that
there's a single trailing newline in the file, you can configure that in the
[whitespace package's](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/whitespace) settings.

![Package Settings](@images/atom/package-settings.png)

### Check Your Configuration

You might have defined some custom styles, keymaps or snippets in
[one of your configuration files](../../using_pulsar/#basic-customization/). In
some situations, these personal hacks might be causing the unexpected
behavior you're observing so try clearing those files and restarting Pulsar.

### Check Your Keybindings

If a command is not executing when you press a key combination or the wrong
command is executing, there might be an issue with the keybinding for that
combination. Pulsar ships with the [Keybinding Resolver](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/keybinding-resolver),
a neat package which helps you understand what key Pulsar saw you press and the
command that was triggered because of it.

Show the keybinding resolver with
**_LNX/WIN_**: <kbd>Ctrl+.</kbd> -
**_MAC_**: <kbd>Cmd+.</kbd>,
or with `Keybinding Resolver: Show` from the Command palette. With the
Keybinding Resolver shown, press a key combination:

![Keybinding Resolver](@images/atom/keybinding-resolver.png)

The Keybinding Resolver shows you a list of keybindings that exist for the key
combination, where each item in the list has the following:

- the command for the keybinding
- the CSS selector used to define the context in which the keybinding is valid
- the file in which the keybinding is defined

The keybindings are listed in two colors. All the keybindings that are matched
but not executed are shown in gray. The one that is executed, if any, is shown
in green. If the command you wanted to trigger isn't listed, then a keybinding
for that command hasn't been loaded.

If multiple keybindings are matched, Pulsar determines which keybinding will be
executed based on the
[specificity of the selectors and the order in which they were loaded](../../behind-pulsar/#specificity-and-cascade-order).
If the command you wanted to trigger is listed in the Keybinding Resolver, but
wasn't the one that was executed, this is normally explained by one of two
causes:

- The key combination was not used in the context defined by the keybinding's selector

  For example, you can't trigger the keybinding for the `tree-view:add-file`
  command if the Tree View is not focused.

- There is another keybinding that took precedence

  This often happens when you install a package which defines keybindings that
  conflict with existing keybindings. If the package's keybindings have
  selectors with higher specificity or were loaded later, they'll have priority
  over existing ones.

Pulsar loads core Pulsar keybindings and package keybindings first, and
user-defined keybindings last. Since user-defined keybindings are loaded last,
you can use your `keymap.cson` file to tweak the keybindings and sort out
problems like these. See the [Keymaps in Depth section](../../behind-pulsar/#keymaps-in-depth)
for more information.

If you notice that a package's keybindings are taking precedence over core
Pulsar keybindings, it might be a good idea to report the issue on that
package's GitHub repository. You can contact Pulsar maintainers on
[Pulsar's github discussions](https://github.com/orgs/pulsar-edit/discussions).

### Check Font Rendering Issues

You can determine which fonts are being used to render a specific piece of text
by using the Developer Tools. To open the Developer Tools press
**_LNX/WIN_**: <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+I</kbd> -
**_MAC_**: <kbd>Alt+Cmd+I</kbd>.
Once the Developer Tools are open, click the "Elements" tab. Use the
[standard tools for finding the element](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/inspect-styles/)
containing the text you want to check. Once you have selected the element, you
can click the "Computed" tab in the styles pane and scroll to the bottom. The
list of fonts being used will be shown there:

![Fonts In Use](@images/atom/fonts-in-use.png "Fonts In Use")

### Check for Errors in the Developer Tools

When an unexpected error occurs in Pulsar, you will normally see a red
notification which provides details about the error and allows you to create an
issue on the right repository:

![Exception Notification](@images/atom/exception-notification.png)

Not all errors are logged with a notification so if you suspect you're
experiencing an error but there's no notification, you can also look for errors
in the developer tools Console tab. To access the Console tab, press
**_LNX/WIN_**: <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+I</kbd> -
**_MAC_**: <kbd>Alt+Cmd+I</kbd>
to open developer tools and then click the Console tab:

![DevTools Error](@images/atom/devtools-error.png)

If there are multiple errors, you can scroll down to the bottom of the panel to
see the most recent error. Or while reproducing an error, you can right click in
the Console tab panel, select `Clear console` to remove all Console output, and
then reproduce the error to see what errors are logged to the Console tab.

::: note Note

When running in Dev Mode, the developer tools are automatically shown with the
error logged in the Console tab.

:::

### Find Crash Logs

::: tabs#debugging

@tab Linux

When Pulsar crashes, it should write a core dump if system settings permit. In
order to find whether the core dump is written and to where, consult the
documentation for your distribution of Linux. Once you have the core dump, you
can save it to send in later if it is needed for debugging.

@tab macOS

When Pulsar crashes, you will find a crash dump in Console.app. You can launch
Console.app using Spotlight or you can find it in
`/Applications/Utilities/Console.app`. Once you have launched the program, you
can find the latest crash dump by following these instructions:

1. Click "User Reports" in the left-most column
2. Find the latest entry in the middle column that starts with `Pulsar` and ends
   with `.crash`

Once you have the crash dump, you can save it to send in later if it is needed
for debugging.

@tab Windows

When Pulsar crashes, you will find a crash dump inside your
`%TEMP%\Pulsar Crashes` directory. It will be the newest file with the `.dmp`
extension. Once you have the crash dump, you can save it to send in later if it
is needed for debugging.

### Diagnose Startup Performance

If Pulsar is taking a long time to start, you can use the [Timecop package](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/timecop)
to get insight into where Pulsar spends time while loading.

![Timecop](@images/atom/timecop.png)

Timecop displays the following information:

- Pulsar startup times
- File compilation times
- Package loading and activation times
- Theme loading and activation times

If a specific package has high load or activation times, you might consider
reporting an issue to the maintainers. You can also disable the package to
potentially improve future startup times.

### Diagnose Runtime Performance

If you're experiencing performance problems in a particular situation, your
[Issue reports](https://github.com/pulsar-edit/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md#reporting-bugs)
will be more valuable if you include a saved profile from Chrome's CPU profiler
that gives some insight into what is slow.

To run a profile, open the Developer Tools with
**_LNX/WIN_**: <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+I</kbd> -
**_MAC_**: <kbd>Alt+Cmd+I</kbd>.
From there:

1. Click the Profiles tab
2. Select "Collect JavaScript CPU Profile"
3. Click "Start"

![DevTools Profiler](@images/atom/cpu-profile-start.png)

Once that is done, then perform the slow action to capture a recording. When
finished, click "Stop". Switch to the "Chart" view, and a graph of the recorded
actions will appear. You can save and post the profile data by clicking "Save"
next to the profile's name in the left panel.

![DevTools Profiler](@images/atom/cpu-profile-done.png)

To learn more, check out the [Chrome documentation on CPU profiling](https://developer.chrome.com/devtools/docs/cpu-profiling).

### Profiling Startup Performance

If the time for loading the window looks high, you can create a CPU profile for
that period using the `--profile-startup` command line flag when starting
Pulsar:

```sh
$ pulsar --profile-startup .
```

This will automatically capture a CPU profile as Pulsar is loading and open the
Developer Tools once Pulsar loads. From there:

1. Click the Profiles tab in the Developer Tools
2. Select the "startup" profile
3. Click the "Save" link for the startup profile

You can then include the startup profile in any issue you report.

### Check Your Build Tools

If you are having issues installing a package using `pulsar -p install`, this
could be because the package has dependencies on libraries that contain native
code. This means you will need to have a C++ compiler and Python installed to be
able to install it. You can run `pulsar -p install --check` to see if the Pulsar
package manager can build native code on your machine.

Check out the pre-requisites in the [build instructions](#requirements-and-dependencies)
for your platform for more details.

### Check if your GPU is causing the problem

If you encounter flickering or other rendering issues, you can stop Pulsar from
using your Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) with the `--disable-gpu` Chromium flag
to see if the fault lies with your GPU:

```sh
$ pulsar --disable-gpu
```

Chromium (and thus Pulsar) normally uses the GPU to accelerate drawing parts of
the interface. `--disable-gpu` tells Pulsar to not even attempt to do this, and
just use the CPU for rendering everything. This means that the parts of the
interface that would normally be accelerated using the GPU will instead take
slightly longer and render on the CPU. This likely won't make a noticeable
difference, but does slightly increase the battery usage on portable devices as
the CPU has to work harder to do the things the GPU is optimized for.

Two other Chromium flags that are useful for debugging are
`--enable-gpu-rasterization` and `--force-gpu-rasterization`:

```sh
$ pulsar --enable-gpu-rasterization --force-gpu-rasterization
```

`--enable-gpu-rasterization` allows other commands to determine how a layer tile
(graphics) should be drawn and `--force-gpu-rasterization` determines that the
Skia GPU backend should be used for drawing layer tiles (only valid with GPU
accelerated compositing).

Be sure to use Chromium flags at the end of the terminal call if you want to use
other Pulsar flags as they will not be executed after the Chromium flags e.g.:

```sh
$ pulsar --safe --enable-gpu-rasterization --force-gpu-rasterization
```
