Alternatively, you can use `apm`:\n\n`apm install atom-clock`\n\n### Features\n* Customizable time format and locale: any format and locale supported by\n[`moment.js`](http://momentjs.com/) is supported by `atom-clock` as well!\n* i18n: specify any locale to get the date in your language.\n* Easy access to time: right-click on the tile in the status bar to copy the\ntime to your clipboard.\n* UTC time: show the UTC time instead of the local time.\n* Multi-platform package: the clock works with Linux, Windows and macOS.\n\n### Settings\n\n##### Time format\nIt specifies the format to use when displaying the time. The package uses\n`moment.js` to format the time, so please refer to the related\n[`moment.js` documentation](http://momentjs.com/docs/#/displaying/format/). The\ndefault value for the time format is `H:mm`.\n\n##### Locale\nIt specifies the locale the clock will use when displaying the time. Its default\nvalue is `en`. Please check the\n[`moment.js` locale folder](https://github.com/moment/moment/tree/master/locale)\nfor a complete list of all supported locales.\n\n##### Clock interval\nIt specifies how many seconds should run between two time updates, and it is\ndefaulted to 60 (one update per minute).\n\n##### Tooltip\nIf enabled, a tooltip will be shown when you hover over the time in the status\nbar to display the time in an alternate format. By default the tooltip is\ndisabled, and the format is `LLLL`.\n\n##### UTC\nIf enabled, both the status bar clock and the tooltip clock (if enabled) will\ndisplay UTC time instead of local time.\n\n##### Show icon\nIf ticked, a clock icon will be shown to the left of the time. It is unticked by\ndefault.\n\n##### Full-screen only\nIf ticked, the clock will only be visible when in full-screen.\n\n##### Right-click to clipboard\nIf ticked, you can right-click on the time in the status bar to copy the current\ntime to your clipboard. When copying the time, the tooltip format is used.\n\n### Some examples\n\n|format|description|display|\n|:----:|:---------:|:-----:|\n|`H:mm`|default date format|![default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472900/32742495-87ac0a00-c8a1-11e7-82f6-49d551bb18fe.png)|\n|`h:mm a`|am/pm format|![ampm](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472900/32742528-9d351d58-c8a1-11e7-8495-f98d0077e0f8.png)|\n|`DD/MM/YYYY, H:mm`|short date format|![short](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472900/32742553-afebf58e-c8a1-11e7-8b13-6538e03b41a8.png)|\n|`MMMM Do, dddd, h:mm:ss a`|long date format|![long](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472900/32742572-bfa9efe4-c8a1-11e7-8e5f-e1b4b6d20282.png)|\n|`[Quarter] Q, MMMM Do YYYY, ddd, h:mm a`|space waster format|![useless](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472900/32742583-cca6f9c6-c8a1-11e7-90b7-4c6ba9ea6480.png)|\n\n### Locales\nWhen a different locale is specified in the settings, the date language will\nchange accordingly. A locale can be defined with its substring, and `moment.js`\nwill take care of selecting the first locale it knows. A substring can be\nspecified in many ways. As example, the Chinese locale for China can be\nexpressed as `zh-cn`, `zh_cn`, `zh-CN` or `zh_CN`.\n\nHere are some examples for locales different from English.\n\n| locale | code | display |\n|:--------:|:------:|:---------:|\n|Arabic|`ar`|![locale_arabic](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472900/32742612-e2e2530c-c8a1-11e7-9595-caa0a2c30a60.png)|\n|Belarusian|`be`|![locale_belarusian](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472900/32742635-f00898a2-c8a1-11e7-92e8-0ab837c743f1.png)|\n|Tibetan|`bo`|![locale_tibetan](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472900/32742652-fc8bb8d4-c8a1-11e7-912a-54d001f5f705.png)|\n|Russian|`ru`|![locale_russian](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472900/32742660-07fb6df4-c8a2-11e7-90f8-d6840ccd1e54.png)|\n|Chinese|`zh_CN`|![locale_chinese_china](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472900/32742676-128a37fa-c8a2-11e7-9479-1e2d8b786111.png)|\n\n### Tooltip\nWhen enabled, the tooltip will contain an extended (and configurable) version of\nthe current time/date.\n\n![tooltip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472900/32742695-2044dbe8-c8a2-11e7-8dc1-1b5a02133211.png)\n\n### Customization\nThe CSS classes of the clock elements allow you to customize the appearance of\nthe clock using your `styles.less` file.\n\n#### `.atom-clock`, `.atom-clock-icon` and `.atom-clock-time`\nThese classes allow you to change the appearance of the whole content of the\nclock (`.atom-clock`), of the icon only (`.atom-clock-icon`), or of the time\nonly (`.atom-clock-time`). A simple entry in the `styles.less` file looks like\nthis:\n\n```scss\n.atom-clock {\n  color: red;\n}\n```\n\n![Atom clock customization](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472900/32742726-36e56e9e-c8a2-11e7-977e-f7fe45cb3b88.gif)\n\nEditing the icon and the time separately:\n\n```scss\n.atom-clock-icon {\n  color: red;\n}\n\n.atom-clock-time {\n  color: green;\n}\n```\n\n![Icon and time customization](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472900/32742784-4c76377a-c8a2-11e7-8ba0-a53ff1fd4fd4.gif)\n\n#### `.atom-clock-tooltip`\nThis class can be used to change the appearance of the tooltip content, in\nconjunction with `.tooltip-inner`.\n\n```scss\n.atom-clock-tooltip .tooltip-inner {\n  color: orange;\n}\n```\n\n![Tooltip customization](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472900/32742810-61a27276-c8a2-11e7-99ed-d202f657c538.gif)\n\n#### `.atom-clock-utc`\nSelective customization can be applied when the UTC time is enabled. This can\naffect both the status bar content and the tooltip content.\n\n```scss\n.atom-clock.atom-clock-utc {\n  color: red;\n\n  &:after {\n    content: \" (UTC)\";\n  }\n}\n```\n\n![UTC Clock](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472900/32742843-7daea0f2-c8a2-11e7-86a1-614b0d3e147e.gif)\n\n```scss\n.atom-clock-tooltip.atom-clock-utc .tooltip-inner {\n  color: red;\n\n  &:before {\n    content: \"(UTC) \";\n  }\n}\n```\n\n![UTC Tooltip](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/472900/32742862-90b47000-c8a2-11e7-8be4-a4464e00d1e1.gif)\n\n### Contributing\n**Like what you see?** Please, feel free to fork this repository, and make any\nchange you like.

Running code inline and in real time is a more natural way to develop. By bringing the interactive style of Light Table to the rock-solid usability of Atom, Hydrogen makes it easy to write code the way you want to.\n\nYou also may be interested in our latest project – [nteract](https://github.com/nteract/nteract) – a desktop application that wraps up the best of the web based Jupyter notebook.\n\n## Features\n\n- execute a line, selection, or block at a time\n- rich media support for plots, images, and video\n- watch expressions let you keep track of variables and re-run snippets after every change\n- completions from the running kernel, just like autocomplete in the Chrome dev tools\n- code can be inspected to show useful information provided by the running kernel\n- one kernel per language (so you can run snippets from several files, all in the same namespace)\n- interrupt or restart the kernel if anything goes wrong\n- use a custom kernel connection (for example to run code inside Docker), read more in the \"Custom kernel connection (inside Docker)\" section\n\n## [Documentation](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/)\n\n- [Installation](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/Installation.html)\n- [Usage](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/Usage/GettingStarted.html)\n  - [Getting started](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/Usage/GettingStarted.html)\n  - [Examples](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/Usage/Examples.html)\n  - [Notebook Import and Export](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/Usage/NotebookFiles.html)\n  - [Remote Kernels](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/Usage/RemoteKernelConnection.html)\n- [Troubleshooting Guide](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/Troubleshooting.html)\n- [Style Customization](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/StyleCustomization.html)\n- [Plugin API](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/PluginAPI.html)\n\n## Plugins for Hydrogen\n\nHydrogen has support for plugins. Feel free to add your own to the list:\n\n- [Hydrogen Launcher](https://github.com/lgeiger/hydrogen-launcher): launches terminals and Jupyter consoles connected to Hydrogen\n- [hydrogen-python](https://github.com/nikitakit/hydrogen-python): provides various Python-specific features\n- [Data Explorer](https://github.com/BenRussert/data-explorer): allows you to use [nteract data-explorer](https://github.com/BenRussert/data-explorer) within Hydrogen\n\nIf you are interested in building a plugin take a look at our [plugin API documentation](https://nteract.gitbooks.io/hydrogen/docs/PluginAPI.html).\n\n## Useful external packages\n\nHere is a list of external packages that could be useful when using Hydrogen (without using Hydrogen plugin API, as such they're mostly only related to the UIs):\n\n- [markdown-cell-highlight](https://github.com/aviatesk/atom-markdown-cell-highlight): highlights code cells in markdown files\n- [Cell Navigation](https://github.com/hoishing/cell-navigation): enables easy jumps between Hydrogen code cells\n- [Hydrogen Cell Separator](https://github.com/jhabriel/hydrogen-cell-separator): gives simple horizontal line decorations for Hydrogen code cells\n\nIf you find/create a package that you think can be useful when used in combination with Hydrogen, feel free to make a PR and add it.\n\n## How it works\n\nHydrogen implements the [messaging protocol](http://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/messaging.html) for [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). Jupyter (formerly IPython) uses ZeroMQ to connect a client (like Hydrogen) to a running kernel (like IJulia or iTorch). The client sends code to be executed to the kernel, which runs it and sends back results.\n\n## Why \"Hydrogen\"?\n\nHydrogen atoms make up 90% of Jupiter by volume.\n\nPlus, it was easy to make a logo.\n\n## Contributing\n\nThanks for taking the time to contribute. Take a look at our [Contributing Guide](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) to get started.\n\nThen, take a look at any issue labeled [good first issue](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) or [help wanted](https://github.com/nteract/hydrogen/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) that has not been claimed.

Inspired by Origami for Sublime Text.\n\n![Basic Usage](https://timomeh.github.io/hey-pane/zero.gif?raw=true)\n\n## Usage\n\nUse <kbd>cmd-shift-k</kbd> on macOS or <kbd>alt-shift-k</kbd> Windows/Linux to toggle the focus on the active Pane.  \n... or override this shortcut with your own by using the command `hey-pane:toggle-focus-of-active-pane`.\n\nEnable/Disable Follow Mode via the Command Palette.  \n... or make your own shortcut by using the command `hey-pane:toggle-follow-mode`.\n\n### Focus\n\nWith _Hey, Pane!_ you can temporarily zoom/focus/enlarge (call it what you want) your active pane without losing sight of all other panes. The active pane gets really big, and all other panes will just peek around the corner. Perfect for focusing on your work or to make more space on a small screen.\n\nIt works with all kinds of pane arrangements.\n\n![Works with all pane arrangements](https://timomeh.github.io/hey-pane/two.gif?raw=true)\n\nIf you want to see all your panes like they were before, just toggle _Hey, Pane!_ again and everything will be back to normal, like nothing happened. _Hey, Pane!_ temporarily saves all the sizes of your panes before focusing on one of them.\n\nResize your panes, _Hey, Pane!_ will recover them.\n\n![Resize your panes](https://timomeh.github.io/hey-pane/one.gif?raw=true)\n\n### Follow Mode\n\n_Hey, Pane!_ can also follow your active pane and resize it, as soon as you change your Pane. Perfect for working with a small screen.\n\n![It follows your active pane](https://timomeh.github.io/hey-pane/four.gif?raw=true)\n\nYou can also use Follow Mode and manually toggling Focus, to get an overview of all active panes. It's a bit like magic<sup>\\*</sup>. 💫\n\nReally, it works with all crazy arrangements! Just look at this pane mess, no problem for _Hey, Pane!_\n\n![Works with all kind of arrangements](https://timomeh.github.io/hey-pane/five.gif?raw=true)\n\n\n\n## Commands\n\n- `hey-pane:toggle-focus-of-active-pane` zooms/unzooms the active Pane\n- `hey-pane:toggle-follow-mode` activates/deactivates Follow Mode\n\n\n<sup>\\*</sup> No real magic involved\n","metadata":{"main":"./lib/hey-pane","name":"hey-pane","engines":{"atom":">=1.0.0 <2.0.0"},"license":"MIT","version":"1.2.0","keywords":["pane","focus","origami","zoom","autozoom"],"repository":"https://github.com/timomeh/hey-pane","description":"Atom Plugin to enlarge the active pane, either with a shortcut or with a super handy follow mode.
